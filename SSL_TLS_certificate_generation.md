Generating a valid, unsuspicious SSL/TLS certificate for an HTTPS request is not particularly difficult, but it involves several steps to ensure that the certificate is recognized as valid by browsers and clients. Here's a guide on how to do it in Ubuntu for a Node.js application.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install Certbot:**

   Certbot is a tool that automates the process of obtaining and renewing SSL/TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt, a free Certificate Authority.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install certbot
   sudo apt install python3-certbot-nginx
   ```

2. **Obtain a Certificate:**

   Certbot can be used to generate certificates. Assuming you have a domain and it is pointing to your server, you can obtain a certificate by running:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
   ```

   Follow the prompts to complete the certificate generation process. This will generate the certificate files in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/`.

3. **Configure Node.js to Use the Certificate:**

   In your Node.js application, you need to use the `https` module to enable HTTPS. Here's a sample setup:

   ```javascript
   const https = require('https');
   const fs = require('fs');
   const express = require('express'); // assuming you are using Express.js

   const app = express();

   // Serve your content
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello, Secure World!');
   });

   const options = {
       key: fs.readFileSync('/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem'),
       cert: fs.readFileSync('/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/cert.pem'),
       ca: fs.readFileSync('/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/chain.pem')
   };

   https.createServer(options, app).listen(443, () => {
       console.log('HTTPS Server running on port 443');
   });
   ```

4. **Automate Certificate Renewal:**

   Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days, so it's important to automate the renewal process. Certbot makes this easy with a cron job or a systemd timer.

   You can test the renewal process with:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```

   If the dry run is successful, you can set up a cron job to run the renewal automatically. Open the crontab editor:

   ```bash
   sudo crontab -e
   ```

   Add the following line to run the renewal twice a day:

   ```bash
   0 0,12 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet
   ```

### Additional Tips

- **Firewall:** Ensure your firewall allows traffic on port 443 (HTTPS).

  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow 443
  sudo ufw reload
  ```

- **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS:** Optionally, you can redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. In Express, you can add a middleware to handle this:

  ```javascript
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
      if (req.secure) {
          next(); // request was via https, so do no special handling
      } else {
          // request was via http, so redirect to https
          res.redirect('https://' + req.headers.host + req.url);
      }
  });
  ```

By following these steps, you can generate a valid and trusted SSL/TLS certificate for your Node.js application on Ubuntu.
